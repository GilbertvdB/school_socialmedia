# Schoolsocials
This is a work-in-progress side project building a social media-like platform for schools, allowing for communication between teachers, parents, and school personnel.

My focus is primarily on the backend, with some frontend development using Tailwind CSS and JavaScript. Iâ€™ve also kept in mind principles like separation of concerns, SOLID principles, and regularly refactored code to maintain quality.

# Features
The main feature is the ability to create a post for a specific group or groups, allowing participants of these groups to interact with the post through comments, similar to a social media platform.

For the comments interaction, I've used Blade along with extensive JavaScript to create an interactive experience on the client side.

# Other features
As this is still a work in progress, here are some of the available features so far:
- Administrators can register new students, parents, teachers, and other personnel.
- Administrators can create and manage classrooms and post groups.
- Students can be linked to parents and classrooms.
- Teachers, personnel, and parents can be linked to one or multiple post groups.
- A Dashboard that shows a feed of posts only from the groups a user belongs to, in most recent order.
- A Dashboard feature that shows an initial feed of 5 posts and loads 5 more on demand as the user scrolls down.
- A Bookmark page to view all bookmarked posts.
- A Post page to create and manage posts.
- A feature to upload documents or images to a post.
- Social media action buttons attached to a post, allowing users to like, comment, or bookmark.
- A comment section feature where users can add, edit, or delete comments.
- Email notifications for invitations, password setup, and new post notifications.

 # Back-end
 For the backend aspect:
 - I've used Breeze for scaffolding authentication and made updates to the authentication files in the controller and vendor folder. Administrators can register users and send a password setup notification.
- I've created standard controllers for CRUD operations. Some return views or RedirectResponse, while others return JsonResponse for use with JavaScript scripts.
- I've created models with proper relationships, including accessors and scopes where necessary.
- Migrations and factories have been created.
- FormRequests and Policies have been implemented.
- Events, Listeners, and Notifications have been added for new user registrations and new posts.
- I've created a Trait for uploading and removing files associated with a post.
- I've developed a combination of views and Blade components for the frontend.
- A separate JavaScript file handles all comment section interactions, including showing, adding, editing, and deleting comments.
- I've written tests using Pest. In my previous work experience, we did not write tests, so this is an area I am eager to learn and practice more.
- I've added a database cache service for the post feed on the dashboard. Cache keys are updated on post creation, updates, and deletion. I also created a command and schedule for invalidating and removing expired cache keys from the database.

# In progress...
- Implementing DB cache for the post feed. [Done]
- Currently writing and adding proper feature and unit tests.

# Possible features
- add Encryptable trait to protect users data in the DB.
- implement search feature
- implement filter feature
